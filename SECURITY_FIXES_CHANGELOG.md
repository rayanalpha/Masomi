# Security & Performance Fixes Changelog

## Overview
This document details all security, performance, and reliability fixes applied to the Lux Gold Catalog e-commerce platform. All changes were implemented systematically to avoid conflicts and maintain backward compatibility.

**Date:** January 2025  
**Platform:** Next.js 15.5.2 with Prisma, NextAuth, PostgreSQL, Supabase  
**Deployment Target:** Serverless (Netlify/Liara)

---

## Phase 1: Critical Connection Management Issues ✅

### 1.1 Prisma Client Singleton Pattern Fix
**File:** `src/lib/prisma.ts`

**Problem:**
- Production environment was creating fresh Prisma instances for every request
- Caused connection pool exhaustion under load
- Race conditions in connection lifecycle management

**Solution:**
- Unified connection management using singleton pattern in both dev and production
- Implemented intelligent instance age tracking (10 min production, 3 min dev)
- Added background disconnect with 5-second delay for in-flight queries
- Eliminated race conditions

**Impact:** ✅ Prevents connection pool exhaustion, improves performance

---

### 1.2 Database Wrapper Refactoring
**File:** `src/lib/db-serverless.ts`

**Problem:**
- `withDatabase()` was creating fresh clients and disconnecting after each operation
- Contradicted connection pooling benefits
- Unnecessary overhead on every database operation

**Solution:**
- Refactored to use global singleton Prisma client
- Removed connection creation/destruction logic
- Simplified error handling while maintaining retry logic
- Connection lifecycle now managed centrally

**Impact:** ✅ Reduced database connection overhead, improved reliability

---

## Phase 2: Memory Management & Security ✅

### 2.1 Rate Limiter Memory Leak Fix
**File:** `src/lib/api-middleware.ts`

**Problem:**
- `setInterval()` cleanup doesn't work in serverless environments
- Rate limiter Map could grow infinitely
- Potential memory exhaustion

**Solution:**
- Implemented probabilistic cleanup (10% per request)
- Added `MAX_RATE_LIMIT_ENTRIES = 10000` limit
- Aggressive cleanup when limit exceeded (removes oldest 50%)
- Added expired entry cleanup with logging

**Impact:** ✅ Prevents memory leaks in serverless environment

---

### 2.2 API Route Error Handling Enhancement
**File:** `src/app/api/products/[id]/route.ts`

**Problem:**
- Missing try-catch blocks in critical routes
- No use of `withDatabaseRetry` wrapper
- Inconsistent error responses
- No specific Prisma error handling

**Solution:**
- Wrapped all database operations with `withDatabaseRetry()`
- Added specific Prisma error code handling:
  - P2002: Unique constraint violations
  - P2025: Record not found
  - P2003: Foreign key constraint violations
- Standardized JSON error responses
- Added product image tracking for storage cleanup

**Impact:** ✅ Improved error handling, better user feedback, enhanced reliability

---

## Phase 3: Input Validation & Security ✅

### 3.1 Search Query Sanitization
**File:** `src/app/api/products/route.ts`

**Problem:**

- No special character sanitization
- Pagination limits too high (100 items)
- Potential SQL injection via special characters

**Solution:**
- Reduced max `perPage` from 100 to 50
- Added 100-character limit on search queries
- Implemented special character sanitization (`[%_]` escaping)
- Added case-insensitive search mode
- Wrapped entire GET handler in try-catch

**Impact:** ✅ Prevents abuse, improves performance, enhances security

---

### 3.2 Image Processing Security
**File:** `src/lib/storage.ts`

**Problem:**
- No dimension validation on uploaded images
- No timeout on Sharp processing
- Potential memory exhaustion from malformed images
- Vulnerable to zip bomb attacks

**Solution:**
- Added `MAX_IMAGE_DIMENSION = 10000` validation
- Implemented `processWithTimeout()` helper with 10-second timeout
- Added dimension validation before processing
- Prevents zip bombs and malformed image attacks

**Impact:** ✅ Protects against image-based attacks, prevents memory exhaustion

---

### 3.3 Request Body Size Limiting
**File:** `next.config.ts`

**Problem:**
- No server-level protection against large file uploads
- Could cause memory exhaustion or DoS

**Solution:**
- Added `api.bodyParser.sizeLimit: '10mb'`
- Added `api.responseLimit: '10mb'`
- Protection enforced before file reaches application code

**Impact:** ✅ Prevents DoS via large uploads

---

## Phase 4: Authentication & Privacy ✅

### 4.1 Session Security Hardening
**File:** `src/server/auth.ts`

**Problem:**
- 30-day session duration too long for admin accounts
- Email addresses logged in plaintext (GDPR violation)
- Increased session hijacking window

**Solution:**
- Reduced `maxAge` from 30 days to 7 days
- Reduced `updateAge` from 24 hours to 1 hour
- Implemented `hashForLogging()` function using SHA-256
- Replaced all plaintext email logging with hashed versions
- Maintained JWT and session maxAge consistency

**Impact:** ✅ Reduced session hijacking risk, achieved GDPR compliance

---

## Phase 5: Database Performance ✅

### 5.1 Database Index Addition
**File:** `prisma/schema.prisma`
