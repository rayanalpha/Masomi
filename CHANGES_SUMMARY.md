## Modified Files

### Core Database Files

   - Creates fresh connections in production
   - Improved connection pooling and timeout settings

2. **`src/lib/db-serverless.ts`**
   - Already had retry logic (kept as is)
   - Provides `withDatabaseRetry()` wrapper

### Page Components
3. **`src/app/catalog/page.tsx`**
   - Replaced direct Prisma usage with `fetchProducts()`
   - Added `export const revalidate = 0;`
   - Added empty state handling

4. **`src/app/page.tsx`**
   - Replaced direct Prisma usage with `fetchProducts()`
   - Added `export const revalidate = 0;`

5. **`src/app/admin/page.tsx`**
   - Uses `withDatabaseRetry()` for dashboard stats
   - Added `export const revalidate = 0;`

6. **`src/app/admin/products/page.tsx`**
   - Uses `withDatabaseRetry()` for product listing
   - Added proper type definitions
   - Added `export const revalidate = 0;`

### Configuration
7. **`netlify.toml`**
   - Added function timeout of 10 seconds
   - Added cache control headers for API routes
   - Added environment variables for production mode
   - Added security headers

## Admin Pages Updated (via script)
The following files had their imports updated from `prisma` to `withDatabaseRetry`:
- `src/app/admin/attributes/page.tsx`
- `src/app/admin/categories/page.tsx`
- `src/app/admin/coupons/page.tsx`
- `src/app/admin/orders/page.tsx`

## Key Architectural Changes

### Before:
- Direct Prisma usage in server components
- No retry logic for database operations
- Connection pooling issues in serverless
- Inconsistent error handling

### After:
- All database operations wrapped with `withDatabaseRetry()`
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Fresh connections for each serverless invocation
- Global error boundary for graceful failure handling
- Proper connection cleanup after operations

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Catalog page loads consistently on refresh
- [ ] Products display without disappearing
- [ ] Admin dashboard shows correct counts
- [ ] No "Application Error" messages
- [ ] Error boundary catches and displays errors gracefully
- [ ] API routes respond within timeout limits

## Next Steps

1. Commit all changes to your repository
2. Push to your deployment branch
3. Clear Netlify build cache
4. Monitor function logs for any remaining issues
5. Test all pages thoroughly after deployment

## Important Notes

- All server components must use `withDatabaseRetry()` or utility functions from `server-data.ts`
- Never import Prisma directly in server components
- Always add `export const revalidate = 0;` for dynamic data pages
- Monitor database connection limits in Supabase dashboard
